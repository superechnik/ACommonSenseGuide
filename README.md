# ACommonSenseGuide

Going through the code exercises in A Common Sense Guild to Data Structures and Algorithms by Jay Wengrow but in Haskell, for fun!
Will try to follow the directions so some Haskell-centric solutions may be discarded for compliance.

To run, install Haskell and Stack, cd to directory and `stack test`
